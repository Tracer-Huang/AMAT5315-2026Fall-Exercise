# Week 4: Continuum Fluid Dynamics

## Overview

This week implements reusable Forward Euler, explicit midpoint, and classical RK4 time integrators; a one-dimensional periodic advection-diffusion solver with Fourier and centered finite-difference derivatives; RK stability and temporal-order validation; and a two-dimensional incompressible vorticity-streamfunction solver.

The two-dimensional solver uses Fourier pseudospectral differentiation, streamfunction-based velocity recovery, and two-thirds dealiasing. The validation studies cover Taylor-Green flow, a seeded random flow, diffusive and advective stability limits, sensitivity to initial conditions, RK4 temporal convergence, and Richardson time-step selection.

The optional Week 4 Challenge is not included.

The implementation was adapted from the peer reference archive
`week4-jmj.zip` supplied by the user. Its Rust and plotting code was checked
against the revised learning sheet, then repaired for the revised `run.json`
contract, the required order-run path, preservation of existing raw runs,
variable seeds and macOS fonts. The images and measurements in this repository
were regenerated from the adapted source, not copied from that archive.

## Requirements

- Rust and Cargo
- Python 3
- Pillow (`PIL`), used by the plotting scripts

Install the pinned Python plotting dependency with
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The numerical solvers are Rust binaries. The Python scripts use only the standard library and Pillow for orchestration, analysis, and rendering.

## Build and Install

From the repository root:

```text
cd week4
cargo build --release
cargo install --path . --force --locked --quiet
mkdir -p artifacts evidence
```

`artifacts/` is intentionally ignored by Git. The committed figures and JSON evidence remain in `evidence/`. The convenience command `make reproduce PYTHON=python3 SEED=2026` runs the commands below in order; it refuses to replace existing raw runs.

## Command-Line Tools

`field` writes one JSON field object to standard output. It supports the exact Taylor-Green field and a deterministic seeded random field.

`fluid` reads a field object from standard input, integrates vorticity with Euler, midpoint, or RK4, prints snapshot diagnostics, and writes `run.json` and `fields.jsonl` under the requested output directory.

Taylor-Green example:

```text
field taylor-green --n 64 |
  fluid --method rk4 --nu 0.1 --dt 0.01 --t-end 1 \
  --every 0.1 --out artifacts/taylor-green \
  > artifacts/taylor-green.tsv
```

Random-flow example:

```text
field random --n 128 --seed 2026 --k-min 2 --k-max 6 |
  fluid --method rk4 --nu 0.004 --dt 0.01 --t-end 10 \
  --every 0.1 --out artifacts/random \
  > artifacts/random.tsv
```

## Reproducing the Evidence

Run these commands from `week4/` in the listed order. They do not assume any pre-existing local `artifacts/` directory.

```text
mkdir -p artifacts evidence

field taylor-green --n 64 |
  fluid --method rk4 --nu 0.1 --dt 0.01 --t-end 1 \
  --every 0.1 --out artifacts/taylor-green \
  > artifacts/taylor-green.tsv
field taylor-green --n 64 --nu 0.1 --t 1 \
  > artifacts/taylor-green/exact-t1.json

python3 scripts/compare_derivatives.py
python3 scripts/plot_line_stability.py
python3 scripts/plot_line_accuracy.py
python3 scripts/plot_taylor_green.py

python3 scripts/run_part3.py
python3 scripts/plot_part3.py

python3 scripts/run_part4.py
python3 scripts/plot_part4.py
```

The committed evidence files are regenerated as follows:

| File | Producing command or prerequisite |
| --- | --- |
| `evidence/line-stability.png` | `python3 scripts/plot_line_stability.py` |
| `evidence/line-accuracy.png` | `python3 scripts/plot_line_accuracy.py` |
| `evidence/taylor-green.png` | Taylor-Green commands above, then `python3 scripts/plot_taylor_green.py` |
| `evidence/random.png` | `python3 scripts/run_part3.py`, then `python3 scripts/plot_part3.py` |
| `evidence/blowup.png` | `python3 scripts/run_part3.py`, then `python3 scripts/plot_part3.py` |
| `evidence/sensitivity.png` | `python3 scripts/run_part3.py`, then `python3 scripts/plot_part3.py` |
| `evidence/order.png` | `python3 scripts/run_part4.py`, then `python3 scripts/plot_part4.py` |
| `evidence/convergence.png` | `python3 scripts/run_part4.py`, then `python3 scripts/plot_part4.py` |
| `evidence/convergence.json` | `python3 scripts/run_part4.py` |

`run_part3.py` generates the random run, Taylor-Green stability scans, random-flow stability scans, and both sensitivity pairs. `run_part4.py` generates the Taylor-Green order study under `artifacts/order/`, the random-flow self-convergence study, `artifacts/part4/order.json`, and `evidence/convergence.json`. The plotting scripts read those Rust-generated artifacts; they do not replace the Rust solver. Set `SEED` to use the same random seed throughout the runs and the independent course checker.

With the Week 4 resource package extracted, independently check the raw
artifacts using `make check PYTHON=python3 SEED=2026
CHECKER=/path/to/week4-resources/week4/checker/check`.

Part 4:

```text

```

The random-flow values use this implementation's deterministic seeded phase generator. They are measurements from seed 2026, not universal constants.

## Generated Artifacts

`week4/artifacts/` contains regenerable simulation output and is intentionally ignored by Git. It is not required to be copied into a clean clone.

Committed evidence is stored in `week4/evidence/`.

## Tests

From `week4/`, run:

```text
cargo fmt --check
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

The Rust test suite covers the integrators, one-dimensional derivatives, periodic wrapping, Nyquist handling, two-dimensional derivatives, streamfunction recovery, dealiasing, Taylor-Green identities, and random-field resolution consistency.
